# Maji Ndogo: Visualizing the Currents of Change
This Power BI project analyzes water access and infrastructure needs in Maji Ndogo, a fictional region facing a critical water crisis. Designed to support national and provincial decision-makers, the report transforms raw survey data into actionable insights for improving water access.

## Key Features:

  - User-centered dashboard design based on stakeholder needs (e.g., President Naledi and provincial leaders).
  
  - National and provincial views showing population coverage, water source types, and access levels (urban vs. rural).
  
  - Financial analysis including cost estimates for infrastructure improvements and budget breakdowns by province and improvement type.
  
  - Strategic drill-through reports to empower localized decision-making.
  
  - Custom DAX measures and calculations to determine clean water access, queue times, infrastructure costs, and improvement impact.
  
  - Bookmark navigation to toggle views (e.g., cost by province vs. cost by improvement type).

## Impact:

This report supports strategic planning by showing how much capital is needed, what it will be spent on, and how many lives will be improved through water infrastructure upgrades.
